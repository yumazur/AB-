# AB-test-Hypotesis
Project «A/B Testing, Hypothesis Prioritization». Conducted prioritization of hypotheses for the ICE and RICE frameworks and analysis of the results of the A / B test, built graphs and calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks.
### Objective: 
Prioritize hypotheses, launch A/B test, and analyze results.
### Research process:
* Data preprocessing;
* Prioritization of hypotheses using the ICE and RICE methods;
* Comparison of cumulative revenue between groups;
* Comparison of cumulative average order value;
* Graph depicting the relative change in cumulative average order value of Group B compared to Group A;
* Comparison of cumulative average number of orders per visitor;
* Graph depicting the relative change in cumulative average number of orders per visitor of Group B compared to Group A;
* Testing the statistical significance of differences in average order value;
* Testing the statistical significance of differences in average number of orders per visitor.
### Skills and tools:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, testing of statistical hypotheses
